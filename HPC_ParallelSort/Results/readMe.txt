results are well formatted to be parsed
#indicates change in variables format: #arrSize,threads,nodes
*indicates a change in algorithm : *newAlgorithmName
neither # nor * indicates a time. algorithms with a single time value have already been averaged by c/c++
	algorithms with multiple time values are the times of each experiment and must still be averaged by the grapher

resultsN.txt is the set of results with N nodes
